# Effect-of-Graphene-Coating-on-Hypervelocity-Impact-Resistance-of-Aluminium-Molecular-Dynamics
Code is written in LAMMPS and Python.


Hypervelocity is very high velocity, approximately over 3,000 meters per second. This is especially
relevant in the field of space exploration and military in anything from minor component degradation
to the complete destruction of a spacecraft or missile. Graphene, an allotrope of carbon has a special set
of properties which sets it apart from the other allotropes. In relation to its thickness, it is about 100
times stronger than the strongest steel. Yet its density is dramatically lower than any steel.
Hypervelocity impact simulations were conducted on Aluminium, one of the most popular and
lightweight metals, to study its resistance to these impacts. The resistance to the impacts was measured
in terms of the reduction in kinetic energy of the indenter, upon impact with the block. The block was
further coated with graphene, and the reduction in energy was monitored.
